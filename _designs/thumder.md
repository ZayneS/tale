##The concept

Calendars are useful for keeping an eye on the future, but they can also help you to restore memories from the past

Smilendar brings the retrospective utility handy and alive on mobile.  Using gesture interactions on mobile, moods and memories can be easily checked in on your calendar.  Once checked-in, Moods and memories are paired with your scheduled activities and appointments,  and surrounded by rich context whenever you want to input. 

Now you remember what made you feel excited and can plan it again.

Smilender is a Interaction Prototype, web app is built with jQuery, and server is written with node.js. by Zheng, Jim, and Sean, as final project for CS147 Intro to HCI. It won the Most Compelling User Need Award, Best Interaction Design Award.
