## More than Schedule 

By visualizing schedules, calendars are useful for keeping an eye on the future. No matter whether met or missed, these schedules become marks of memories once they passed due.

Plus, schedules reveal how busy a person will be, and perhaps hint the level of stress he is going through.

**What would happen if we help people relate memories and moods to their schedules?** Can this help people to catch more memories of happiness, and accumulate achievement and confidence for a busy next month?

## Emojis and new mobile interactions

Smilendar, an mobile interaction prototype, is our trial to meet such need.

It brings the retrospective utility handy and alive on mobile.  The main interaction uses emojis for quick in-the-moment check-in of moods and achievements to scheduled activities. Input of images, memos and other rich informations can be done after activities when user is more available.

In addition, swipe gesture is applied for spontaneous check-in, to help users to catch unplanned happiness or sadness.

Just to simply turn the phone to horizontal, stored moods and memories can easily to be revealed.

## Go through all design process

Smilendar was the final project for <a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/courses/cs147/" target="blank">CS147 Intro to HCI</a>, finished with awesome team work with [Jim Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jim-wang-09662236/) and [Sean Kemper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-kemper/). From need finding to product, we went through all design process along this project.

The final web app was built with jQuery, and server was built with node.js and hosted on AWS. The project won the _**Most Compelling User Need Award**_, as well as _**Best Interaction Design Award**_ of the class.
