<h2>A preparatory work for design feature training.</h2>

<p>Happy label was a crowdsourcing image labeling game inspired by the Game with a Purpose (GWAP) , It was the final project of <a href="https://hcicourses.stanford.edu/cs376/2017/" target="blank">CS376 Human Computer Interaction Research</a>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nayinan/">Yinan Na</a> and I spent amazing four weeks together to build the game and test among students.</p>

<p>We created a human computation game, with the predefined category structure provided, and tested online to see if it can improve the efficiency, label quality and fun to play.</p>

<p>This game was also a preparatory work for vehicle design prediction. We intended using GWAP to label car images for aesthetic design feature training.</p>

<h2>Game with a Purpose</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~biglou/GWAP_CACM.pdf" target="blank">ESP games</a> has been proved with significant result in human involved image tagging activities. Previous studies on ESP games, however, has shown the <em><strong>&quot;Obvious&quot;</strong></em> issue: people tend to guess &quot;obvious&quot;, easy words that provide less informative information for labeling. Related works have been done to encourage variety, such as <em>Taboo Words</em>, and <em>Dynamic Scores</em>. </p>

<p>We looked to address this issue from a different path. Inspired by the work about <em>Human In the Loop for visual recognition</em>, we thought by bringing domain knowledge structure, human participants behavior shall be guided to not that easy-guess-by-participant, but more preferred-by-host results. In our project, we specifically <strong>incorporated predefined categorizations levels of labels, into the basic setting of a ESP game</strong>, </p>

<p>This game consist of following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>  A predefined tree structure of   categories</li>
<li>  Options are limited: shuffled in case of collusion.</li>
<li>  Progressive guessing: feels like Who wants to be Millionaire</li>
<li>  Dynamic score rewarding</li>
</ul>

<p>The web client was built with Html/Css &amp; jQuery, the server was written with node.js, and database was on firebase</p>

<p>Take a look at our live demo videos at Youtube:</p>

<p><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'>    <iframe title="YouTube video player" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/35H1t3_qbSg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

To evaluate the efficiency and accuracy of the image labeling with our design, we published HappyLabel online to collect data. And in addition, we conducted a user interview involving 5 players to evaluate the gameplay of HappyLabel. You can find the result in attached image.</p>
