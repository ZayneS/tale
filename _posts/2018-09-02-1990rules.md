Community Marketing is a powerful strategy for early startups. Different from advertising, promotion or PR, which uses one-way communication to attain potential customers, Community Marketing engages existing customers with an active, non-intrusive, two-way conversation. A good community marketing strategy can bring following benefits:

1. Maintain engagement of existing customers, and increase their life time value.
2. Facilitate Word-of-Mouth Marketing to acquire and convert potential customers.
3. Drive the product innovation
4. Support business reinvention

## A vibrant community structure follows 1990 rule

No matter what kind of products you make, ultimate customers of your products can be segmented into follow 3 groups.

<br>

### 1% people will follow product development process, and even participate into as contributors.

This type of users are also named “Super Users”. Almost all of them are target users of your products. They are kind-hearted and very supportive. willing to participate in your user research sessions, or to test your imperfect MVPs and give valuable feedbacks. In a lot of times, they are the actual drive of your product development. Apart from that, they can also help you to operate your community! As the best friends of your company, the 1% worth most of your time and attention.

### 9% people are willing to promote your products, and recommend then to their friends. 

A lot of them are Key Opinion Leaders in specific online interest groups, forums or other social medias. They help you to promote products among their peers and followers, and trigger word-of-mouth marketing. Their endorsements are very important to your brand credibility. The 9% are very influential, and you need to manage their expectation carefully.

<br>

### 90% people are just shopping around, but they are the majority that buy and use our products.

You can generally call them Customers. of who the actual demographic can be quite diverse, some may be people that you have not expected initially. They usually do not directly interact with you.  

I learnt the 1990 rule in a public speech from Danny Liu, the founder of a fast-growing Greek yogurt brand LePur in China. We followed it in our community operation.

## How did we build a vibrant community?

### Find the most loyal 1% from existing users
1. Filter out most active participants in our app. Some of them have been along with Haowu since very beginning. They are very supportive to our business renovation!
2. Form several online groups together,  e.g. invite them to WeChat Groups for closer interaction. The top 1% are also very willing to become friends with each other.
3. Update business and product progress in a regular schedule. They like to follow our progress and share happiness and bitter.
4. Invite them to test under-development products and gather feedbacks. It is a good field for user-centered design process, and we expect them to find flaws and bugs as much as possible.
5. Hang out in person from time to time, just like we usually do with our other close friends!

We only gathered 2 Wechat group of 1% users. However, we look for quality over quantity. These super users were quite active,

### Exploit the 9% from influential online communities

1. Target the right community. A good community has to be active, has a lot of target users, and many nonprofessional KOLs. 
2. Make friends of KOLs in these communities, Add them on wechat with brand’s official account for closer interaction. Since most KOL’s care about privacy, 1-on-1 communications with us are a better option.
3. Invite them to try our newly released products, take nice photos and write reviews. And this time we expect them to love and recommend our products, so that we need to make sure products’ main functions are refined and ready to ship.

At Nakko, We successfully acquired over 300 KOLs in several popular online communities, like haohaozhu and xiaohongshu. They have created over 1000 product reviews , as well as countless beautiful photos of our products.

<br>

### Acquire the 90% with the help from the 1% and the 9%
1. Encourage KOLs to share reviews and photos in target communities. and most of them are really willing to do so.
2. Sponsor professional KOL’s community campaigns, with gifts ,exclusive discounts and "limited edition” products.
3. Invite the 90% to follow Wechat official account, or download apps, so that we can direct interact with them in future! 
4. Run viral referral programs among 90% to acquire even more customers.

One of the top reviews gathered over 4,000 likes and 25,000 collections, generated strong purchasing interest among followers.
