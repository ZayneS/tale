title: "Differences between an Internet PM and a Merchandise PM"
author: "Zheng"

In 2015, our company started with a mobile community, and it also became my first product to build. 

Later in 2017, the company’s focus shifted from online e-commerce platform to in-house merchandise brand. Thus inside the company, the concept of product meant no just digital products like payment system or shopping cart, but also physical products like chandeliers or baskets. In order to cope with expanded business, we built our merchandise product team.

Since then, we have had two types of product development process, and likewise, two types of PMs. It gave me a very good chance to compare differences between them.

Let us first started with illustration of two processes applied in Nakoo:

To clarify, none of these two processes is thorough or rigorous. They were, however, good enough for our practice.

## Similar thinking mode: to solve the right problem

The basic logic is the same: to build product that customers love. and to make that happen, both processes shall go through 5 steps: Needfinding, Solution Ideas, Implement Solutions, Test & Iteration, and Go To Market.
 
Documents required in both processes also show similar format. Our Product Requirement Document (PRD) for internet products was based on a template from Baidu. While Product Planning Document (PPD) for merchandise was inspired by P&G and housewares chain Cracker Barrel.

Although the product development frameworks are similar: To build a solution for a specific problem, difference are also obvious since these two type of products serve different business models, show very different forms, and thus require divergent knowledge concept as well as management skills.

## Different knowledge concepts and skills

<br>

### 1: Pricing: how much do you want your customer to pay for?

Profit goal for merchandise is very different from that for internet products. Merchandise usually is not paid by advertisers, but by customer themselves. Pricing, which an internet PM may not need to worry about at all, becomes an essential decision for a merchandise PM to make when releasing product to the market.

According to Principles of Economy, price is determined by the equilibrium of demand and supply in a market. It requires a PM to have a good sense of market dynamics to come up a winning pricing strategy. He needs to consider 1. competitions, 2. customer’s perceived value， 3. company’s marketing strategy as well as financial goals. Handy tools and methods can be found in Business schools curriculums and publications. But, to master pricing skills, it usually take years for a PM in retail and merchandise business.

### 2: Cost Management: be careful about how much it will cost!

The most appealing merit of internet products is the (almost) zero marginal cost for expansion. Such merit, however, cannot be found on physical products. A good PM should always consider cost breakdown and management when developing new physical products.

A typical cost model consists of material cost (how much to spend on product components) and manufacturing cost (how much to spend to produce such product). Bill of Materials is the best tool for material cost break down. and to understand manufacturing cost, a PM needs to get familiar with quite a mount of new concepts in manufacturing process

The simple math is Profit = Price - Cost. To meet the profit goal, a PM has to do better than just defining features, mastering pricing and cost management are at the same time equally essential.

### 3: Slower developing cycle & Decision Process

To bring a product design into reality, the develop team needs to finish following manufacturing design. During this process, engineer will not only figure out which structures and materials are most feasible to meet design needs, they also redesign the manufacturing process. This is very costly and time-consuming.

This brings huge challenge for product iteration. We have to extend the time span of development from weeks to months. PMs have to learn how to use other methods, such as mock-ups and prototypes for faster evaluation and feedback. 

In addition, PMs have to be more careful about product decisions, since each iteration is now way more expensive than that in internet business. We set 3 internal gates for product review along the development process: Design Review to check appearance, Prototype Review to check functionality, and Pricing & Cost Review to check whether or not can we make profit out of this product.

### 4: User Acquisition vs Sales Operation

To increase the adoption rate of internet products, traffic of users is needed. We call it user acquisition, or in today’s words, growth hacking.

To increase the sales of merchandise products, traffic of visitors is the more the merrier, adequate supply of products is also crucial. The ideally most efficient growth can be achieved when production & supply exactly meet the volume of moving sales. 

If sales is faster than supply, products will soon out of stock, and investment for traffic acquisition shall be wasted. Customers will complain and turn to your competitors. On the contrary, if sales is slower than supply, inventory will increase and swallow your cash flow. Thus, once we entered retail business, besides user acquisition, we added a role of sales operation, to balance the visitor growth & product supply.

Although a PM usually does not take the responsibility of sales operation, it is important for he to be familiar the concept of dynamic equilibrium between supply & demand. Since he will be highly involved in product marketing (e.g. write selling points, refine product packaging etc). as well as product optimizing for mass production.

## Mind the gap, and find new experts for new business

The concept of modern product management was actually started in 1931 at Procter & Gamble, the well-known and most successful fast-moving-consumer-goods company.  And in 90s, it was adopted by software companies and later internet companies. You can find more about the history and evolution of product management in Martin Eriksson’s Post at Mind the Product.

When looking through the evolution, we can understand why the underlying basic thinking modes of product management in different industries are similar. However, the diversities in forms of products, and in models of businesses, have generated the different requirements of product management roles in terms of knowledge scope as well as skills.

Once we have learnt the differences, we know better about how to hire, and how to design our own career path.
