In 2015, our company started with a mobile community, and it also became my first product to build. 

Later in 2017, the companyâ€™s focus shifted from online e-commerce platform to in-house merchandise brand. Thus inside the company, the concept of product meant no just digital products like payment system or shopping cart, but also physical products like chandeliers or baskets. In order to cope with expanded business, we built our merchandise product team.

Since then, we have had two types of product development process, and likewise, two types of PMs. It gave me a very good chance to compare differences between them.
