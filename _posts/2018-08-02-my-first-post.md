brand new post all by myself yah!


How R-CNN works can be summarized as follows:

1. Pre-train a CNN network on image classification tasks; for example, VGG or ResNet trained on ImageNet dataset. The classification task involves N classes. 
NOTE: You can find a pre-trained AlexNet in Caffe Model Zoo. I donâ€™t think you can find it in Tensorflow, but Tensorflow-slim model library provides
2. pre-trained ResNet, VGG, and others.
Propose category-independent regions of interest by selective search (~2k candidates per image). Those regions may contain target objects and they are of different sizes.
3. Region candidates are warped to have a fixed size as required by CNN.
4. Continue fine-tuning the CNN on warped proposal regions for K + 1 classes; The additional one class refers to the background (no object of interest). In the fine-tuning stage, we should use a much smaller learning rate and the mini-batch oversamples the positive cases because most proposed regions are just background.
5. Given every image region, one forward propagation through the CNN generates a feature vector. This feature vector is then consumed by a binary SVM trained for each class independently. 
The positive samples are proposed regions with IoU (intersection over union) overlap threshold >= 0.3, and negative samples are irrelevant others.
6. To reduce the localization errors, a regression model is trained to correct the predicted detection window on bounding box correction offset using CNN features.
