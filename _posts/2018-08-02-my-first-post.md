title:  "Challenges when we applied persona in our work"

In product design practices, we applied personas to represent different user types that might use our mobile apps, and/or purchase housewares products we provide. 


It was a very new concept when persona was first introduced to the team in 2015. There were many problems occurred to us while we kept implementing such tool. Step by step, our product team have came up our own solutions and adjustments. I list some of them as follows:

## How many user interviews we should do to come up a persona?

User interviews usually can be quite time consuming. Team need to know how many user feedbacks it will take for us to make confident design decisions. There is, however, no single correct number to this answer.

In the post: The Right Number of User Interviews, Michel Seaman brought up an idea of interview saturation: when new increment interviews don’t show significant difference.

Or in another word:  **keep interviewing until you don’t learn much from new interviews**.

This rule was found effective in our practice. In one interview regarding houseware product users, we interviewed 24 people to find 2 typical personas. In another session about video contents, however, we found 13 participants were enough. Numbers really varied, for the team feel confident to move on. 

Michel Seaman’s post dig a little bit deeper about how to estimate the right sample size for different interviews. And it is really insightful to read about.

## How many details should we include in a good persona?

Well, there is no single correct number either, of details required for a persona document. We found that less but essential information tend to be more effective than a thorough depict of a typical user. And we put effort to come up following pieces in a valid personal document.

1. _**Name**_
2. _**Demographic**_, is no doubt necessary, to better interpret users social status.
3. _**Environment**_, where this person lives, works or acts designated behaviors.
4. _**Quotes (Say)**_
5. _**Behaviors (Do)**_, e.g. a day-in-the-life narrative. is the key for us to find unsolved problems or unmet needs.
6. _**Attitudes (Feel)**_, feelings and concerns, reveal the underlying motivation of users desire and needs.
7. _**Goals (Think)**_,  is about the ideal stage this user wants to achieve. 

4-6 actually derive from the empathy map in Stanford’s design thinking methodology.

## Other teams keep asking: Is this the right persona? 

We faced often such questions from other teams or even members within product team. It was all natural since not everyone got an opportunity to participate in user research sessions. How could we effectively convey personas to them, and ease their doubt about unfamiliar user scenarios?

1. **Ensure the alignment between persona and market research results**. User research usually serves as further probe to testify market decisions. Personas, as results, shall align with market research results. Thus we needed to select users within designated segmentation.

2. **Show not just conclusions, but also process**. During presentation, guilde audiances through the analysis process, which can help them understand how a persona was formed.  

3. **Rich media content to increase persona’s fidelity**. Persona is fictional, but the users it represents are not. We deliberately collected images, videos and audio recordings about users behaviors and sayings during our interviews. We then used them along with the descriptive persona 

These methods proved to be effective in our practice to bring entire team on to same page regarding users and personas. At the same time, to invite more team members to involve in interview sessions was always helpful for efficient communication regarding results.

## Did we make the right design for this persona?

On a consumer facing product, team members will often have lots of product ideas and won’t rely as much on a specific feature lists or design requirements.

This is very common, for that it is fairly easy for everyone to relate personal experience to target user's scenarios. It saves time from educate team member. It can be, however, very challenging to identify whether it is the user's need, or your need, since they may look similar (but not identical).

To address this challenge, we chose 2 ways:

1. **Visualize persona in office for team to revisit easily.**
2. **Fast prototyping and testing**, let target users to give immediate feedbacks before we move further investment.

In practice, we found products that did follow these two methods were more likely to become well received in target customers.

We printed personas out and post them on the wall

## Talk to your users and all else will follow

Following process to create and apply persona in product development was not easy, It is not hard science or engineering process that you have to do to reach success. It did take a while for our team to get used to this process and appreciate the benefit of user research. But, the core spirit of over all user research could be very simple: talk to your users and all else will follow. If you have an open mind and curious about what users do and want, you will figure out how to utilize all of these tools.
